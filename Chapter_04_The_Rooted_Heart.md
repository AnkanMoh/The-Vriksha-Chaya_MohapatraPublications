## Chapter 4: The Rooted Heart

The diesel engine of the bus was a desperate mechanical heartbeat against the vast, indifferent silence of the awakening countryside. Arjun’s breath plumed against the cold glass, his gaze fixed on the receding darkness. The image of the root, tipped with its umbral bloom, reaching from the shadow of the banyan he’d glimpsed outside Trichy, was seared into his mind. It wasn't just a manifestation; it was a declaration of intent. The Pishach wasn't merely bound to one tree; it was a network, its essence spreading through the earth, through the water, tethered to its summoner—to him. The connection, forged by his foolish invocation, was now an anchor, dragging him towards its heart.

The unsettling vibration in his hand had intensified. He dared to look again. The purplish hue had deepened, encroaching further up his fingers, the veins now a tangled thicket beneath the darkening skin. A faint, rhythmic throbbing emanated from his palm, an echo of the guttural hum he’d heard weeks ago. It felt less like a wound and more like a seed. A parasitic life taking root within him. The ache in his stomach, too, persisted, a dull, gnawing pain that hinted at something deeper, more invasive. He remembered the old tales, the whispered fear of the Pishach not just killing, but *inhabiting*. Was his body, his very essence, slowly being prepared for its dominion?

He gripped the worn armrest, the rough texture a small comfort. The bus was headed towards Bhubaneswar, a waypoint before he could reach his ancestral village in Odisha, the place where his grandfather, he hoped, held the keys to understanding and perhaps severing this curse. But the journey felt interminable, each mile a test of his waning strength. The air inside the bus, thick with the stale scent of human bodies and recycled air, was still tainted by that faint, unmistakable odour of damp earth and decay, a scent that seemed to emanate from his own clothes, his own skin. He saw a few fellow passengers glance his way, their expressions a mixture of mild curiosity and subtle unease. Had they noticed the darkening of his hand? The grim pallor of his skin? He quickly pulled his sleeve down, feigning sleep.

As the first streaks of grey light bled into the eastern sky, the bus slowed, its brakes hissing. They had reached the outskirts of Bhubaneswar. The city was a sprawling, chaotic entity, a stark contrast to the ancient stillness of the rural landscape. Horns blared, auto-rickshaws weaved through traffic, and the air vibrated with the cacophony of urban life. Yet, even amidst the noise and haste, Arjun felt that subtle pressure, the sense of an ancient awareness watching from the fringes. He instinctively scanned the skyline, searching for the tell-tale silhouette of a large banyan, a guardian tree that might harbour the Pishach’s influence.

He disembarked at the main bus terminal, a sprawling concrete expanse alive with the morning rush. The air was heavy with the smell of street food – sizzling samosas, sweet jalebis – but the undercurrent of decay remained, a disturbing counterpoint. He needed to find a taxi, a shared car, anything to get him to his village. He approached a weary-looking driver slumped against his vehicle.

"Village Ganjam," Arjun said, his voice raspy. "Near Chilika Lake."

The driver, a man with rheumy eyes and a perpetually tired expression, grunted. "That's a good three hours, baba. And the roads… not for the faint of heart." He eyed Arjun’s darkening hand, visible beneath his pushed-up sleeve. "You look like you've seen better days. You sure you can make the journey?"

Arjun forced a nod, the effort sending a wave of dizziness through him. "I have to." He offered the driver a handful of crumpled notes, more than the fare, a desperate plea for haste. The driver’s eyes narrowed slightly, then he shrugged, a silent acceptance of the unspoken urgency.

The journey was a blur of dusty roads, passing through villages and rice paddies. As they neared the coast, the air grew heavy with the salty tang of the sea, mingling with the persistent scent of damp earth. The landscape began to change, the vegetation becoming denser, more tropical. The legendary Chilika Lake, a vast, brackish expanse, began to appear on the horizon, a shimmering mirage of silver and blue under the midday sun.

Arjun’s village, a cluster of terracotta-roofed houses nestled amidst palm groves, felt like stepping back in time. The familiar scent of woodsmoke and drying fish replaced the city’s exhaust fumes, yet the underlying odour of the Pishach persisted, a ghostly presence clinging to the humid air. He paid the driver, his legs feeling shaky as he stepped out onto the dusty village path.

He saw his grandfather almost immediately, sitting on the porch of their modest home, his face etched with the wisdom of years, his eyes bright and sharp despite his age. He looked up as Arjun approached, his gaze falling immediately on Arjun’s hand. A flicker of understanding, and something akin to dread, crossed his face.

"Arjun," he said, his voice calm but laced with a deep concern. "You have been touched by the old roots."

Arjun stumbled onto the porch, collapsing onto a stool. He couldn’t speak, the words catching in his throat. He simply held out his hand, the dark veins stark against his pale skin.

His grandfather examined it, his touch surprisingly gentle. He ran a thumb over the discoloured skin, his brow furrowed. "It is deeper than I feared. The *prana-vinimaya* has begun its harvest. Not just a debt owed, but a parasite growing within." He looked at Arjun, his eyes filled with a profound sadness. "You did not merely summon it. You have offered yourself as its vessel."

"Rohan," Arjun choked out, the name a raw wound. "My roommate… it took him. A knot of roots… from his chest."

His grandfather nodded slowly, his gaze distant. "The Aranya-Rakshak, or the Vriksha-Pishach as some call it, is not just a spirit of the forest. It is a reflection of decay, of parasitic hunger that grows when life is stifled, when the natural order is disrupted. It thrives in places where the veil between worlds thins, where the earth remembers ancient wounds." He gestured towards the vast expanse of the Chilika Lake, its waters shimmering under the sun. "This land remembers. The old banyan grove, the one near the forgotten temple… that is its heart. That is where it sleeps, and where it wakes."

He explained that the cult his grandfather had spoken of, the one linked to the Vriksha-Pishach, had not simply faded; it had been suppressed. Centuries ago, during a period of intense drought and famine, a desperate ritual had been performed near the Mother Tree in the grove. They had sought to appease the entity, to beg for sustenance, but the ritual had been perverted, its true purpose twisted by fear and desperation. Instead of appeasing it, they had inadvertently amplified its power, binding it more tightly to the land, and to the bloodline of those who performed the ritual. The Vriksha-Pishach, or Aranya-Rakshak, was not just an entity that haunted trees; it was a force that had been *awakened*, its hunger amplified by human despair, its essence now a festering wound upon the land, seeking ever more life force to sustain itself. The ancient banyan in the grove was the conduit, the nexus through which it extended its influence.

"NIT Trichy," Arjun said, the pieces clicking into place with horrifying clarity. "The banyan there… it's a descendant, or perhaps a cutting from that Mother Tree. It carries the Pishach's influence."

"The roots travel," his grandfather confirmed, his voice grim. "The earth remembers. And when the words are spoken, when the intent is present, the tendrils reach out. It fed on Rohan because you were physically closest, and perhaps, because the curse sought to teach you its brutal calculus. A life for a life. But if no life is willingly given, it will claim its due from the one who disturbed its slumber." He looked at Arjun, his eyes filled with a mixture of compassion and grim resolve. "And it will claim you, piece by piece, until there is nothing left but a hollow shell for it to inhabit."

A sudden chill swept through the humid air, an unnatural drop in temperature that made the palm leaves rustle violently. The midday sun seemed to dim, as if a vast shadow had fallen over the land. Arjun’s grandfather’s eyes widened.

"It knows we are speaking of it," he whispered. "It feels the threat to its anchor."

Arjun looked towards the edge of the village, towards the dense, ancient grove of banyans that loomed on the horizon, a dark, tangled mass against the vibrant green. Even from this distance, he could feel its oppressive presence, a palpable weight pressing down on his chest. The scent of decay, mingled now with the cloying sweetness of overripe jasmine, intensified, thick and suffocating.

He felt a sharp, stabbing pain in his chest, directly over his heart. He gasped, clutching his sternum. It was more intense than the ache in his stomach, a searing, tearing sensation, as if something were physically trying to burrow its way through his ribs. The darkness on his hand pulsed in time with the agony, and he felt a faint, sickening tremor beneath his feet.

His grandfather’s face contorted in horror. "No! Not yet! You are not ready!"

Arjun’s vision swam. The vibrant colours of the village blurred, replaced by swirling shades of brown and green. He could feel it – a deep, primal root, thick and sinewy, pushing its way out from his chest, seeking purchase not just on his flesh, but on his very soul. It was not a reflection this time. It was real. With a sickening, wet tearing sound, a gnarled, impossibly dark root, pulsing with a faint, sickly luminescence, erupted from the fabric of his shirt, forcing its way through his skin, drawing forth a dark, viscous ichor. It twisted and writhed in the humid air, a living manifestation of the curse, its tip like a bud, not yet blooming, but taut with the promise of unfathomable darkness. It was reaching, not towards his grandfather, but towards the earth, seeking to anchor itself, to begin the final, devastating process of consumption. The heart of the Pishach was no longer merely in the grove; it was now beating within him.
