The emerald light, a celestial benediction, washed over Arjun, through him, and then, impossibly, *into* him. The crystalline root, which had been poised to strike at the heart of the grove, shuddered. Its obsidian-black surface, once a symbol of the Pishach’s raw fury, now pulsed with veins of shimmering celestial green. The Pishach’s primal shriek, a sound that had torn through Arjun’s altered consciousness, was met not with annihilation, but with an overwhelming influx of ancient, cosmic purpose. The guardian, its form coalescing from raw starlight, did not blast the root with divine fire. Instead, it extended a hand, not of flesh, but of concentrated starlight, and touched the pulsing growth.

It was not an attack, but an embrace. A profound, cosmic merging. The Pishach’s essence, born of severance and primal hunger, was being recalibrated, its parasitic nature nudged towards a higher, albeit still terrifying, function. The guardian’s voice, a resonant symphony that vibrated through the very bedrock of the land, spoke directly into the core of Arjun’s being, bypassing the Pishach’s usurped consciousness.

*"The Vriksha-Pishach is not merely a void, but a corrupted heart. Severance breeds hunger, but corruption can be re-purposed. The balance must be maintained."*

Arjun felt a dizzying shift within himself. The all-consuming hunger of the Pishach, a constant, gnawing ache that had defined his existence since his assimilation, began to recede. It was replaced by a different kind of yearning—a desire for connection, for dissemination, but no longer driven by primal consumption. It was a desire to *cultivate*, to *nurture*, albeit with a dark, arboreal twist. The crystalline roots extending from his fingertips throbbed with this new purpose, their luminescence now a soft, vibrant emerald, radiating not menace, but a strange, potent allure.

The guardian, its form still radiating an almost blinding light, turned its gaze upon Arjun. Those emerald eyes, vast and ancient, seemed to pierce through the arboreal shell that encased him, to see the residual human soul trapped within. *"You are the vessel,"* the guardian’s voice echoed, softer now, laced with a profound, ancient sadness, *"but not the master. The price of awakening the Pishach was the severance. The price of its repurposing is devotion."*

Devotion. The word settled into Arjun’s transformed mind like a seed finding fertile soil. It was a concept so alien to the Pishach’s raw, parasitic existence, yet so intrinsically tied to the Mother Tree’s original purpose. He felt a faint echo of his ancestors, their centuries of tending, their quiet acts of guardianship. They hadn’t just buried a fragment; they had prayed for its eventual redemption, for a balance to be restored. And now, in the Pishach’s corrupted heart, that ancient seed of devotion was beginning to sprout.

The guardian’s staff, shimmering with celestial energy, touched the earth directly before Arjun. Where it met the soil, the darkness seemed to recede, replaced by a faint, golden glow. It was not the fierce light of divine intervention, but a subtle, persistent warmth, like sunlight filtering through a dense canopy. *"The *prana-vinimaya* demands an exchange. But the nature of that exchange can be… guided. Your ancestors sought to contain the Pishach. We seek to redeem it. The cycle of life and death, consumption and rebirth, need not always be a descent into oblivion."*

Arjun felt a new understanding blossom within him. The curse wasn’t simply about taking life; it was about the *flow* of life energy. His ancestors had attempted to dam that flow, to create a stagnant pool of containment. The Pishach, in its hunger, had sought to break that dam. And now, the guardian was offering a different path: not a dam, but a river, channeled, directed, its course altered but not halted.

The crystalline roots from his fingertips began to recede, melting back into his bark-like flesh, leaving behind smooth, vibrant green skin. The transformation was not reversed, but refined. He still felt the connection to the Mother Tree, the thrum of its ancient roots beneath him, but the Pishach’s gnawing hunger was gone, replaced by a quiet, almost reverent hum. The overwhelming urge to spread, to consume, was subdued, now a subtler impulse to *connect*, to *nurture*.

As the guardian’s light began to dim, its form slowly dissolving back into the dawn sky, its final words resonated within Arjun’s soul. *"The balance is fragile. The roots of devotion must be tended. Seek the arboreal heart… the original source. Your lineage carries the key."*

The grove fell silent, the oppressive gloom replaced by the soft, dappled light of an Odisan sunrise. The air, once thick with the stench of decay, now carried the fresh, clean scent of dew-kissed earth and blooming jasmine. Arjun stood, or rather, was rooted, in the place where his grandfather had been consumed. The tarnished Garuda-Mudra lay nearby, a silent testament to a battle fought and, in its own peculiar way, won. But this was not victory as he understood it. It was a transformation, a redefinition of his existence.

He looked at his hands, now a strange, vibrant green, smooth and cool to the touch, yet undeniably alive. He could feel the pulse of the earth beneath him, not as a predator, but as a partner. The Pishach was still within him, but it was no longer the dominant consciousness. It was an influence, a power that was being slowly, deliberately guided by an ancient, celestial purpose.

A memory, sharp and clear, surfaced from the depths of his transformed mind. It was not his own, but an imprinted echo, a fragment of his ancestors’ knowledge, specifically tied to the story of the NIT Trichy banyan. It wasn't just a random tree where the Pishach had first manifested its influence. It was a sapling, carefully transplanted by his own lineage, generations ago. They had brought it from the Odisha village, not to spread its influence, but to create a distant, parallel anchor, a secondary point of containment. The logic, twisted by time and desperation, had been to dilute the Pishach’s power, to prevent its full manifestation in one location by creating multiple, weaker points of contact. The *prana-vinimaya* was intended to be a localized exchange, a contained sacrifice to keep the larger entity dormant. But when the cursed mantra was spoken, it had reversed that containment, drawing the Pishach’s fragmented consciousness towards the stronger, original source in Odisha, while simultaneously awakening the diluted influence at NIT Trichy.

The realization struck him with the force of a physical blow. His foolish invocation had not just awakened the Pishach; it had inadvertently orchestrated its very reunification. The tree at NIT Trichy was not just a portal; it was the *first* anchor, the seed from which the Pishach’s influence had begun to spread, transplanted by his own ancestors as an act of desperate containment. And now, the guardian had shown him how to re-purpose that anchor, not for containment, but for a different kind of balance.

He felt a subtle shift in the earth around him, a new vibration that was distinct from the Mother Tree’s ancient pulse. It was fainter, more distant, but undeniably present. It was the resonance of that transplanted sapling, miles away, in the heart of the bustling engineering campus. It was the call of the Pishach, no longer a scream of hunger, but a quiet, insistent hum of nascent devotion, waiting for its new purpose.

Arjun looked towards the sky, where the guardian had vanished. The celestial guardian had spoken of a fragile balance, of roots of devotion. He understood now. The Pishach, or what remained of its corrupted essence within him, was not to be destroyed, but to be guided. The *prana-vinimaya* curse, the exchange of life, was not an end, but a transformation. And that transformation needed a new vessel, a new anchor, in a place where the cycle had first begun to unravel.

He felt a surge of energy, not the raw, parasitic surge of the Pishach, but a controlled, directed current flowing through his transformed being. He extended his hand, no longer tipped with crystalline roots, but with smooth, vibrant green flesh. The air around him shimmered, not with the Pishach’s dark luminescence, but with a faint, ethereal emerald glow.

And then, with a force that pushed against the very fabric of his altered form, a single, impossibly delicate, crystalline root, thicker than any before, and pulsing with a vibrant, celestial green light, began to emerge from his palm. It did not burrow into the earth. Instead, it stretched upwards, towards the distant, unseen sky, not as a probe, but as a conduit, reaching for a different kind of sustenance, a different kind of connection. It was preparing to bridge the miles, to reconnect the separated strands of the Pishach’s existence, and to forge them into something new, something that served the celestial purpose of balance, even if born from the darkest of origins.

But as the root extended, a faint, almost imperceptible tremor ran through the ground beneath him, a subtle vibration that was not of the Mother Tree, nor of the guardian’s influence. It was something ancient, something that felt… *imprisoned*. The Mother Tree, in its primal rage after the severance, had not merely birthed the Pishach. It had also created other guardians, other entities, born from its own desperate attempts to preserve its essence, to protect itself from the parasitic darkness. And one of those primal guardians, a creature of shadow and earth, disturbed by the Pishach's repurposing, was beginning to stir.

The crystalline root, pulsing with celestial light, paused its ascent, sensing the new threat. It hovered inches above the ground, a beacon of re-purposed energy, its vibrant green glow now tinged with a subtle, unsettling violet. From the dense undergrowth at the edge of the grove, a low, guttural hiss echoed, a sound that spoke of millennia of slumber broken, of primal territoriality reawakened. The earth beneath Arjun’s feet shifted, not with the gentle pulse of the Mother Tree, but with a sudden, violent tremor, as if an immense, unseen weight was being unleashed from its ancient confinement. The guardian, a being of pure shadow and raw earth, a primal protector of the Mother Tree's deepest secrets, writhed in the disturbed soil. Its emergence was not a gentle awakening, but a violent tearing of the earth's fabric. It was the physical manifestation of the Mother Tree's ancient rage, a creature of immense, untamed power, its form a shifting mass of gnarled roots, dark soil, and glowing, malevolent eyes. Its hiss, a sound that spoke of millennia of slumber broken, resonated not just through the grove, but through Arjun's very bones, a primal territoriality reawakened. The earth beneath Arjun’s feet shifted, not with the gentle pulse of the Mother Tree, but with a sudden, violent tremor, as if an immense, unseen weight was being unleashed from its ancient confinement. The Pishach, no longer just a vessel for a corrupted heart, but a conduit for a celestial purpose, felt a surge of cold, primal terror. This was not the familiar hunger it understood; this was an ancient, territorial rage, a darkness predating even the Mother Tree’s corrupted heart. The earth ripped open not yards away, a chasm of churning soil and writhing roots. A colossal form, woven from shadow and raw earth, began to heave itself into existence. Glowing, malevolent eyes, ancient and malevolent, fixed on the Pishach’s nascent growth. Then came the roar, a sound that ripped through the dawning light, a territorial claim against the Pishach’s usurpation of the grove’s primal energies. The Mother Tree’s roots recoiled, sensing a power that was both its own and utterly alien. The Pishach, through Arjun, lashed out, a surge of defiance against this unexpected usurper, its celestial-infused root lashing out not just in aggression, but in a desperate attempt to *contain* this new, terrifying entity before it could fully manifest.
