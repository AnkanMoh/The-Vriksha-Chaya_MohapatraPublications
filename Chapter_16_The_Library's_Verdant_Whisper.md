The harsh, flickering fluorescent lights of the lecture hall hummed a discordant lullaby, a sterile counterpoint to the primal dread that now coiled in Arjun’s gut. The lecture hall was empty, a stark, echoing expanse of plastic and polished linoleum, yet the sense of being watched was palpable, a suffocating pressure that tightened around his chest. The emerald eye, a raw emerald set not in flesh but in the Pishach’s spectral breast, had been the final terrifying flourish of its departure. Now, in its place, a fresh horror bloomed: the same emerald eye, impossibly, was seared into the lectern, pulsing with a faint, predatory intelligence. It was a claim, a territorial marking by the Vriksha-Pishach.

He stumbled forward, his legs unsteady, his mind a tempest of fragmented images: the ancient banyan grove in Odisha, the weeping wounds on the Mother Tree, the pulsating crimson bloom that had transformed into that malevolent emerald eye. The psychic tether that had pulled him from the grove was still humming within him, a persistent vibration that synced with the lecture hall’s oppressive thrum. He could feel the phantom roots, finer now, attempting to anchor themselves not just to him, but to the very structure of this place, the edifice of knowledge, the breeding ground of ambition and anxiety.

The unsettling calm he had experienced in Odisha, the strange sense of vital energy, lingered. It was a residue, a subtle exchange that left him feeling unnervingly clear-headed, devoid of the gnawing fear that had been his constant companion. This was the Vriksha-Pishach’s insidious offering: peace, a temporary absence of dread, bought with the very anxieties it preyed upon. He looked at his hands, the crimson scar on his arm a stark reminder of his previous entanglement. The ache was gone, replaced by a disturbing numbness, a void where his pain had been. It was a chillingly effective method of pacification, lulling its victims into a false sense of security as it burrowed deeper.

He moved towards the lectern, drawn by an unseen force, the emerald eye’s gaze seeming to follow him. As he approached, the etched eye pulsed brighter, its green luminescence casting an unholy glow on the sterile surfaces. He noticed then, with a fresh wave of revulsion, that the ‘etching’ wasn’t an etching at all. It was a growth, organic and terrifying, a creeping, vein-like pattern of emerald green that pulsed with a slow, rhythmic beat, mimicking the Pishach’s own heart. It was a living manifestation, a seed planted within the very heart of the institution.

His gaze flickered to the reflection on the darkened monitor screen at the front of the hall. The skeletal form of the Vriksha-Pishach was gone, but its influence remained. The emerald eye, now embedded in the lectern, seemed to cast a faint, green shimmer across the glass. And behind his own reflection, just at the edge of perception, he saw it: a faint, verdant whisper. Not a physical shape, but a distortion in the light, a subtle weaving of green tendrils that coalesced and dispersed, like shadows playing tricks on the eye. It was the Vriksha-Pishach, extending its reach, establishing its network through the labyrinthine corridors of NIT Trichy.

The oppressive hum of the campus, once a distant backdrop, now felt like a physical vibration, resonating deep within his bones. It was the collective subconscious of a thousand stressed students, a potent cocktail of deadlines, exam pressure, and existential uncertainty, all being channeled, amplified, and harvested. The *prana-vinimaya* curse had evolved beyond a simple life exchange; it was now a perpetual, insidious siphon, drawing sustenance from the very air, from the ambient anxieties of everyday life.

He remembered the fragmented whispers of his ancestors, the cryptic warnings about the transplanted sapling. It hadn’t been meant to dilute the Pishach’s power, but to create a new nexus, a point of propagation free from the Mother Tree’s direct influence. And NIT Trichy, with its dense population of young, anxious minds, was the perfect nursery. The Vriksha-Sanyog, the union he had witnessed in Odisha, was not just a fusion of the Pishach and the Mother Tree; it was an integration into a larger ecosystem – the human-created environment.

He turned, his gaze sweeping across the rows of empty plastic chairs. They stretched out like an ordered, sterile forest, their forms eerily reminiscent of the younger trees in the grove. As he watched, he thought he saw a faint, almost imperceptible movement at the edge of his vision. A subtle sway, as if a gentle breeze had swept through the hall. But there was no breeze. The air was still, heavy, and charged with an unnatural stillness.

Then, he heard it. Faint, barely perceptible, a soft rustling sound, like dry leaves skittering across a stone floor. It seemed to eman from the chairs, from the very structure of the hall. He strained to hear, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against the unnerving calm that the Pishach’s influence had instilled. The rustling grew louder, more insistent, coalescing into a low, breathy whisper that seemed to coil around him. It was not human speech, but a sound that evoked the deep, ancient language of the forest, the murmur of roots shifting, of sap flowing, of leaves conversing in the wind.

Arjun felt a cold sweat prickle his skin. The Vriksha-Pishach’s tendrils, no longer just psychic, were beginning to manifest physically, subtly altering the environment around them. The chairs, the walls, perhaps even the books in the library stacks, were becoming conduits, extensions of the Pishach’s growing presence. The emerald eye on the lectern pulsed again, its verdant light seeming to feed the spectral whispers.

He needed to reach the library. The library stacks, with their dense collection of books, their quiet corners, and their pervasive scent of aging paper, had always held a certain stillness, a sense of contained knowledge. Now, that stillness felt pregnant with a new, arboreal menace. If the Pishach was seeping into the very fabric of the campus, the library, with its intimate connection to the students’ anxieties, would be a prime target for its deeper integration.

As he turned towards the exit, his foot brushed against something soft and yielding on the floor. He looked down. Nestled amongst the dark linoleum, where a few moments before there had only been sterile emptiness, was a single, vibrant crimson petal. It lay incongruous and stark against the grey, exuding a faint, metallic scent, the unmistakable aroma of spent *prana*. It was a bloom, a miniature echo of the terrifying fruit he had witnessed in Odisha, dropped by the Vriksha-Pishach as it established its new domain.

He reached for it, his hand trembling, but before his fingers could touch it, the petal began to disintegrate, dissolving into a fine, emerald-green dust that shimmered momentarily before vanishing completely. A subtle exchange. A life force consumed, transformed, and dispersed.

Suddenly, a new sensation. A faint vibration, originating from his own arm, the one with the crimson scar. It wasn't pain, not the residual ache he had grown accustomed to. It was a deep, resonant thrumming, as if something within him was awakening, responding to the presence of the Vriksha-Pishach. He lifted his arm, his eyes widening in disbelief. The crimson scar, where the Pishach's root had once burrowed, was now faintly glowing with an emerald green light, mirroring the eye on the lectern. The scar wasn't just a reminder of his past; it was becoming a conduit, a part of the Vriksha-Pishach's network.

The verdant whispers in the lecture hall intensified, no longer distant rustling but a chorus of breathy sighs, as if the very air was exhaling. The plastic chairs seemed to subtly shift, their forms elongating, their legs appearing to twist and thicken, mimicking the gnarled roots of a young sapling. Arjun realized, with a chilling certainty, that the Vriksha-Pishach was not merely manifesting; it was *growing*, using the students’ anxieties as fertilizer, the campus structures as its soil.

He backed away from the lectern, his gaze fixed on his glowing scar, the whispers swirling around him like a psychic mist. He had to get to the library. He had to find a way to sever this connection, to understand the true nature of this Vriksha-Sanyog before the entire campus became a fertile ground for the Pishach’s horrifying bloom.

As he reached the heavy lecture hall door, he hesitated. He could hear it now, not just in his mind, but a faint, almost audible sound emanating from beyond the door, from the heart of the campus. It was the low, resonant hum of electronics, yes, but interwoven with it was a new sound, a soft, persistent *thump-thump-thump*, like a slow, deliberate heartbeat. And with it, a new scent began to permeate the air, cutting through the ozone and the metallic tang of prana: the rich, earthy aroma of damp soil, strangely out of place in this sterile, concrete environment.

He pulled the door open. The hallway stretched before him, bathed in the same harsh fluorescent light, but the pervasive hum was louder here, the heartbeat more pronounced. And then he saw it. Across the polished floor, leading away from the lecture hall and towards the distant entrance of the library, was a trail. Not of footprints, but of a dark, glistening substance, almost like sap, that pulsed with a faint, emerald green luminescence. It snaked across the linoleum, weaving and branching like the roots of a tenacious plant. And at the end of this trail, just visible in the distance, the heavy wooden doors of the library seemed to exhale a faint, verdant mist. From within the library, a low, guttural whisper, far more distinct than the subtle sighs in the lecture hall, rose to meet him. It was the sound of ancient wood groaning, of roots seeking purchase, and at its center, that impossibly clear, deliberate heartbeat. The library, he realized with a sickening certainty, was where the Vriksha-Pishach’s growth was most advanced. And as he stepped into the hallway, the emerald glow on his scarred arm intensified, pulsing in sync with the distant heartbeat, a silent invitation into the verdant heart of the library’s awakening horror.
