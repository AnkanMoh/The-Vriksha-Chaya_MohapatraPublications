# The Stack Room Specter

---

The air in the NIT Trichy library stack room was a stagnant breath, heavy with the cloying perfume of decaying paper and forgotten dust. Arjun, an ECE student whose existence usually revolved around circuit diagrams and the ceaseless hum of debugging code, found himself adrift in this sepulchral quiet. He wasn’t supposed to be here. The stack room, a labyrinth of towering shelves that seemed to swallow the meager light, was strictly off-limits. But a dare, fueled by lukewarm hostel chai and an overdose of bravado, had landed him amongst the forgotten tomes.

His fingers, usually nimble on a keyboard, felt clumsy and alien against the brittle, yellowed pages of the manuscript. It lay open on a scarred wooden table, illuminated by a single, flickering fluorescent tube that cast a sickly greenish hue. The script was unlike anything he’d ever encountered – intricate, angular, and imbued with a disturbing fluidity, as if the ink itself had been alive. It smelled faintly of dried blood and something earthy, like disturbed grave soil. A shiver, unrelated to the persistent chill that clung to the room like a shroud, traced its way down his spine.

He was about to close the book, the foolishness of his endeavor finally dawning on him, when his gaze fell upon a particular passage. The characters seemed to writhe under his scrutiny, and a strange compulsion seized him. He traced the lines with his index finger, the rough texture of the ancient paper snagging at his skin. A peculiar rhythm began to build in his chest, a discordant drumbeat against the library’s silence. The words themselves, though he didn't understand their meaning, felt… potent. Like static electricity building before a storm.

Suddenly, a jarring *crack* echoed through the stack room. The single tube light above him sputtered violently, casting dancing shadows that elongated and contorted the already unsettling rows of books. A wave of profound cold washed over him, leeching the warmth from his skin and settling deep into his bones. It was the kind of cold that felt ancient, primordial, as if the very fabric of the building had exhaled a glacial sigh.

He looked at his watch. 6:00 PM. Twilight. The exact moment the manuscript seemed to have been waiting for.

Across the quadrangle, in the polished glass facade of the men’s hostel, a thousand tiny reflections stared back. Arjun, a solitary figure hunched over the forbidden text. The flickering lights of the library. And then, something else.

A ripple. A distortion.

In the reflection, directly behind where he was standing, a shape began to coalesce. It was impossibly tall, its form amorphous, a shifting silhouette against the dying light. Something dark, and many-limbed, seemed to writhe within the glass, a grotesque parody of movement.

Arjun’s breath hitched. His heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic bird trapped in a cage of bone. He spun around, his senses screaming.

Nothing.

The air behind him was empty. The stack room was as it had been moments before – dusty, silent, still. The only sound was the frantic pounding of his own blood in his ears. But the image, seared into his mind by the reflection, remained.

He stumbled back, his hand instinctively reaching out for the table, his fingers brushing against the cool, smooth surface of the manuscript. The paper felt different now, slick, almost damp, despite the arid air of the room. A faint, musky odor, like damp earth and decaying leaves, began to fill his nostrils, mingling with the scent of old paper.

He looked back at the hostel window. The reflection was clear again, showing only the empty quadrangle, the neat rows of hostels bathed in the fading twilight. The distortion was gone. Vanished.

Had he imagined it? The flickering lights, the sudden chill, the… vision? He was an engineering student, a rationalist. He dealt with physics, with predictable outcomes. This was… illogical. A trick of the light, a product of his own overactive imagination, fueled by the dusty, unsettling atmosphere and the dare.

But the cold lingered. And the smell. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, but it was there, clinging to the edges of his awareness. And the manuscript lay open, its angular script seeming to mock his attempt at rationalization.

He carefully closed the book, the sound unnervingly loud in the sudden quiet. His hands trembled. He had to get out of here. Now.

As he backed away from the table, his foot caught on something. He looked down, expecting a stray stool or a misplaced box. Instead, his eyes fell upon a single, dark, thread-like tendril, barely visible against the grimy floorboards, snaking out from beneath the table. It was impossibly thin, yet unyieldingly rigid, and it pulsed with a faint, almost imperceptible thrum. It hadn't been there before. He was sure of it.

Arjun’s breath hitched again. The thrumming in his chest intensified, mirroring the faint pulse emanating from the tendril. A prickling sensation crept up his arm, an echo of something impossibly cold.

He stared at the tendril, mesmerized, horrified. It twitched. Then, slowly, deliberately, it began to retract, slithering back beneath the table, disappearing into the shadows as if it had never been.

But the cold had deepened. And the smell… it was no longer faint. It was a suffocating presence, thick and cloying, a primal scent of decay and something far more sinister.

Arjun didn't wait to investigate further. He turned and fled, his footsteps echoing far too loudly in the silent stacks. He ran, not stopping until he burst out of the library doors and into the comparatively sane, if fading, light of the quadrangle. He didn’t look back. But as he ran, a raw, animalistic terror seized him, a certainty that burrowed deep into his mind: *It had seen him. And it remembered.*
