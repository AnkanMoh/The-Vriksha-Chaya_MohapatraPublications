The trail of pulsing, emerald sap was a stark, obscene testament to the Vriksha-Pishach’s intrusion. It snaked across the sterile linoleum of the NIT Trichy corridor, a glistening, viscous artery carrying the curse’s corrupting essence. Arjun followed it, his gaze fixed, his crimson-scarred arm throbbing with an unsettling, rhythmic luminescence that mirrored the trail’s slow, deliberate pulse. The soft, guttural whisper from the library doors seemed to coil around him, a siren song of ancient wood and thirsty roots, drawing him into the heart of the burgeoning horror. The heartbeat, once distant, was now a palpable thrum, vibrating not just in the air, but in the very marrow of his bones.

He was no longer just a witness, or a target. The Vriksha-Sanyog, in its new, terrifying evolution, had claimed him. His scar, once a symbol of his past trauma, was now a direct link, a beacon that resonated with the Pishach’s influence. The unsettling calm, the absence of fear, remained, a chilling testament to the insidious exchange of *prana*. He felt strangely detached, as if observing his own descent into this arboreal nightmare from a safe, objective distance. This placid clarity, he knew, was the curse’s most potent weapon, numbing him to the primal terror that should have been paralyzing him.

As he neared the library entrance, the earthy scent of damp soil grew stronger, a bizarre olfactory intrusion in the otherwise sterile environment. It mingled with the familiar smell of aging paper and binding glue, creating a cloying, unnatural perfume. The heavy wooden doors of the library, ancient and dark, seemed to loom larger, their grain appearing to writhe with a subtle, verdant energy. The emerald mist that had been exhaling from them thickened, swirling like phantoms in the fluorescent light.

He pushed open one of the doors. The transition was instantaneous, jarring. The oppressive hum of the campus was amplified here, a deafening symphony of stressed circuits and anxious minds, but it was now underscored by the Vriksha-Pishach’s steady heartbeat. And the scent of damp earth was overwhelming, as if he had stepped not into a library, but into the shadowed depths of a primeval forest floor.

The vast hall of the library, usually a sanctuary of quiet study, was transformed. Towering bookshelves, usually filled with ordered knowledge, now seemed to lean inward, their wooden structures twisted and elongated, their shelves bowed as if under an immense, unseen weight. The light from the fluorescent tubes flickered erratically, casting dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with arboreal life. And everywhere, coiling around the bases of shelves, snaking up the carved oak pillars, and creeping along the ceilings, were thick, bark-like tendrils, pulsing with that same emerald luminescence. They seemed to be actively growing, weaving a new, terrifying architecture within the hallowed halls of learning.

In the center of the main reading area, where a large, ornate reading table usually stood, was a grotesque tableau. The table itself was still there, but it was being consumed. Roots, thick as a man’s arm and pulsating with emerald light, had burst through its polished surface, their thorny texture tearing at the wood. They writhed upwards, intertwining and thickening, coalescing into a nascent form. And at the very heart of this organic eruption, where the emerald trail had originated, was a single, impossibly vibrant crimson bloom. It was not the flower he had seen in Odisha; this one was larger, more developed, its petals unfurling with a sinister grace. And nestled within its depths, staring out with an unnerving clarity, was the emerald eye. It pulsed with a predatory intelligence, its gaze sweeping across the transformed library, a silent declaration of ownership.

The Vriksha-Pishach was not merely extending its influence; it was *rooting* itself. The library, a repository of collected human thought and anxiety, was its chosen soil. Arjun felt a tremor run through him, not of fear, but of a strange, cold recognition. He remembered the ancient texts, the fragmented lore he had studied in his youth, tales of entities that could manifest not just in flesh and shadow, but within the very fabric of human creation. The Vriksha-Pishach, through the Vriksha-Sanyog, had found a way to infect the symbolic, the constructed, the artificial.

His crimson-scarred arm pulsed with an intensity that now sent a faint warmth through his skin. The emerald glow seemed to deepen, a whisper of connection, a silent acknowledgment of his complicity. He was no longer just a residual link; he was becoming an integral part of its new ecosystem. He glanced down at the scar. It had always been a mark of the Pishach’s corruption. Now, it felt like a brand, a sigil of its possession.

A soft, dry rustling sound emanated from the surrounding bookshelves. Arjun turned, his heart beginning to thrum a more frantic beat against the imposed calm. The books, their spines bearing the weight of countless studies and narratives, seemed to shift and sway. The dry pages fluttered, not as if stirred by a breeze, but as if sentient, whispering secrets in an ancient, arboreal tongue. He saw it then, on the spine of a thick, leather-bound tome, a faint, emerald green pattern, mimicking the eye on the lectern in the lecture hall. It was spreading, weaving itself into the very knowledge contained within these walls.

He remembered a specific passage from his grandmother’s faded diary, a cryptic entry about the Vriksha-Pishach’s primal hunger. It wasn't just for *prana*; it was for the *essence* of things, the fundamental life force that imbued even inanimate objects with a form of spirit. It could corrupt the clay of a temple idol, the wood of a sacred banyan, and now, it could corrupt the paper and ink of human knowledge. The Vriksha-Sanyog had provided the means, and NIT Trichy, with its burgeoning anxieties and its vast stores of concentrated thought, was the perfect breeding ground.

The crimson bloom at the center of the reading table pulsed again, and a single, viscous drop of amber fluid fell from its core, landing on the polished wood. It sizzled on contact, leaving a small, burnt-out mark. But it was not the amber fluid that caught Arjun’s attention. It was the residue left behind, a faint, emerald shimmer. The bloom wasn’t just a receptacle; it was a catalyst, transforming the consumed *prana* into a medium for its own growth, its own manifestation within the material world.

He took a step towards the central eruption, his scarred arm tingling with an almost unbearable intensity. The emerald eye fixed on him, its gaze not hostile, but appraising, almost expectant. He felt a sudden, profound understanding wash over him. The *prana-vinimaya* was not just a life exchange; it was a transformation. The Vriksha-Pishach didn't merely take life; it transmuted it, feeding on the raw energy of fear and ambition, and in return, it offered… something else. Something that resonated with the very nature of knowledge, of growth, of propagation.

Then, a new whisper brushed against his ear, distinct from the rustling of pages. It was a voice, faint but clear, seemingly emanating from the emerald eye itself. It spoke not in the ancient tongue of the forest, but in a language he understood intimately: the precise, almost sterile dialect of academic discourse.

“*The fundamental premise of recursive propagation is insufficient for sustained existential resonance.*”

Arjun froze. It was theoretical physics. Advanced theoretical physics, the kind discussed in the very halls he had just left. The Vriksha-Pishach was not just feeding on fear; it was consuming and integrating the very *concepts* that fueled the students’ anxieties. It was learning, evolving, not just as a creature of primal hunger, but as an entity capable of abstract thought, of philosophical inquiry.

“*A localized nexus of amplified psychic energy, when cross-referenced with the latent potential within informational substrates, allows for exponential integration.*”

The crimson bloom unfurled further, revealing not just petals, but intricate, bark-like filaments that seemed to pulse with a faint, inner light. The emerald eye blinked, a slow, deliberate motion that sent a jolt of primal fear, quickly suppressed, through Arjun. The *prana-vinimaya* was more than a curse; it was a perversion of growth, a parasitic assimilation of not just life force, but of the very intellectual and emotional energy of its victims.

He looked at the bookshelves around him, the books that had once represented order and understanding. Now, they seemed to pulse with the same verdant energy as the tendrils coiling around them. The emerald patterns were spreading, creeping across spines, blooming on the edges of pages. The library was not just being invaded; it was being *rewritten*.

His scarred arm flared with an intense emerald light, a sharp, almost searing sensation. He looked down, his breath catching in his throat. The crimson scar had shifted. It was no longer just a mark on his skin. It was now a complex, intricate pattern of emerald green, resembling not a wound, but a miniature, stylized banyan root, branching and twisting across his forearm. It felt strangely warm, almost alive.

Suddenly, the steady heartbeat that had been resonating through the library stopped. The silence that followed was deafening, a vacuum that sucked the very air from his lungs. The emerald light from the tendrils and the central bloom dimmed, their pulsating rhythm faltering. The Vriksha-Pishach seemed to be… withdrawing.

Arjun felt a sudden, jarring sense of displacement. The earthy scent faded, replaced by the sterile ozone he had first encountered. The ornate oak pillars and twisting tendrils dissolved, shimmering like a heat haze. The crimson bloom, with its emerald eye, flickered and distorted.

He was no longer in the library.

He was back in the lecture hall. The same harsh fluorescent lights hummed their sterile tune. The same rows of empty plastic chairs stretched before him. The emerald eye etched into the lectern was gone, leaving only the polished surface of the wood. It was as if the entire invasion of the library had been a hallucination, a dream.

But his arm… his arm was still marked. The intricate emerald root pattern remained, pulsing faintly with a residual warmth. And then, he heard it. A soft, almost inaudible whisper, coming not from the lectern, but from the plastic chair directly in front of him. It was dry, rustling, like leaves skittering across stone. It was the same sound he had heard just moments before, in the library.

The Vriksha-Pishach had not withdrawn. It had *accelerated* its growth, planting seeds of itself within the lecture hall, using the library as a temporary nexus for its more complex manifestations. And now, it was retracting its more visible tendrils, leaving behind subtler, more insidious manifestations. The library had been a testbed. The lecture hall was its next target.

As the whisper intensified, growing into a chorus of dry, rustling sighs that seemed to emanate from every chair, Arjun saw a new pattern emerge. Not on the lectern, but on the very plastic of the nearest chair. A faint, emerald green vine was beginning to unfurl, growing organically from the material, reaching outwards. And at its tip, a single, perfectly formed crimson bud was beginning to swell, its colour a stark, terrifying echo of the bloom he had witnessed just moments ago. The true harvesting of *prana*, the deeper integration of knowledge and anxiety, had not been a momentary display. It had been a reconnaissance, a preliminary probing. And now, the Pishach was ready to fully blossom, not just in the hidden depths of the campus, but in the very spaces where students grappled with their deepest fears. The lecture hall, once a place of learning, was becoming a nursery for terror. And as the crimson bud on the chair began to swell, Arjun felt the emerald root on his arm pulse violently, a silent, terrifying herald of what was to come.
