The crimson light, once a vibrant pulse of augmented hunger, now sputtered erratically, like a dying ember in a gale. The Vriksha-Pishach, its corrupted core overloaded by the amplified *prana* of Rohan and the ancient amulet, writhed within Arjun's transformed being. The grotesque idol, unearthed from the earth’s deep embrace, pulsed with a strange, inert warmth, a stark counterpoint to the chaos erupting within the entity that had once been Arjun. Below it, the ground trembled, not with the violent tremors of the earth guardian’s reawakening, but with a deep, resonant hum, as if the land itself was exhaling a long-held breath. This was the ancient safeguard, the buried failsafe, now stirring from its millennia-long slumber.

Arjun felt the Pishach’s struggle as if it were his own. The chaotic energies warred within him: the lingering celestial influence, the primal earth-rage, and now, this new, immense power that threatened to unravel the very fabric of his being. The crimson root, still tethered to his palm, pulsed feebly, its connection to the Pishach fraying like ancient rope. He felt a chilling certainty: the Pishach was not merely being disrupted; it was being *unmade*. The ancient power, deliberately buried to neutralize unchecked corruption, was now fulfilling its purpose with a ruthless efficiency.

The grotesque idol, now fully exposed, sat like a dark omen on the disturbed soil. It radiated a faint, earthy aroma, a scent that spoke of forgotten rituals and the desperate attempts of his ancestors to placate a hunger they could not truly understand. It was the original offering, a crude appeasement designed not to amplify, but to satiate the Pishach, to channel its insatiable need into a predictable, contained ritual. His ancestors had buried it, perhaps fearing its power, perhaps seeking to erase the memory of such primitive appeasement. But the Pishach, in its avarice, had found a way to twist its purpose, to use the amulet as a conduit for a far more destructive consumption.

As the ancient power from below intensified, the ground around the idol began to swirl, not with chaotic energy, but with a controlled, deliberate movement. It was as if the earth was meticulously rearranging itself, forming a nascent pedestal for the unearthed relic. The Pishach, thrashing within Arjun, felt the intrusion, the sheer, overwhelming presence of this rising force. Its corrupted essence, so used to dominance, recoiled from this ancient, balanced power.

Then, a new realization dawned within Arjun, a chilling whisper that bypassed the Pishach’s frantic screams and the earth’s deep hum. The ancient safeguard was not merely a passive force of neutralization. It was a *conduit*. It was designed to absorb and re-direct corrupted energy, to transform it, to return it to the earth’s embrace in a purified form. And that purification process… it required a vessel.

The crimson root, flickering and weak, spasmed. A final, desperate surge of Pishach energy pulsed through it, not towards the NIT Trichy anchor, but inwards, towards the grotesque idol that was now being subtly lifted by the shifting earth. The Pishach was attempting to merge with the idol, to imbue it with its remaining corrupted essence, a final, desperate act of self-preservation, or perhaps, a perverted attempt to re-establish the original ritual of appeasement.

Arjun felt a sharp, agonizing tearing sensation within him. The Pishach, his Pishach, was being ripped away, not in a fiery explosion of divine retribution, but in a slow, agonizing process of dissolution. His bark-like skin, which had once pulsed with vibrant green and then sickly yellow, now began to recede, revealing pale, human flesh beneath. The transformation was not being reversed, but unraveled. The Pishach’s grip was loosening, its corrupted essence being drawn out, not towards a celestial guardian, but towards the ancient idol that was now fully exposed, pulsating with a faint, earthy light.

The ground continued to churn, the hum growing louder, more insistent. The idol, now a foot above the soil, was enveloped in a vortex of slowly swirling earth and faint, ethereal light. The Pishach’s essence, a swirling mass of dark energy, was being drawn into it, drawn into the gaping maw of the grotesque carving. It was a terrifying spectacle, the culmination of a curse that had sought to consume and corrupt, now being fed back into its own origin, its own intended appeasement.

Arjun’s vision cleared, the oppressive crimson fading to reveal the soft, dappled light of the Odisan dawn. He felt a profound weakness, a hollow emptiness where the Pishach’s gnawing hunger and the celestial guardian’s repurposed intent had resided. He looked at his hands, no longer bark-like or green, but pale, human, and trembling. The crimson root was gone, retracted back into his palm, leaving behind only a faint, stinging sensation. He was human again, or at least, he was no longer the Pishach’s vessel.

But the silence that followed was not one of peace. The deep hum of the earth continued, now focused entirely on the rising idol. The Pishach was gone, its essence absorbed, its corruption being purified. But the *prana-vinimaya* curse remained. It had demanded life, and it had taken Rohan’s. It had demanded power, and it had siphoned the earth’s ancient strength. Now, it seemed, it was demanding a new anchor, a new way to manifest.

The idol, still floating, began to glow with a faint, inner light, a dull, amber hue that pulsed in time with the earth’s resonant hum. It was no longer merely an object of appeasement; it was becoming something more. The Pishach’s absorbed essence, being purified by the ancient safeguard, was imbuing the idol with a new kind of power, a re-purposed energy that was still tied to consumption, but no longer purely destructive. It was becoming a focal point, a nascent manifestation of a controlled hunger.

Arjun, weak and disoriented, stumbled backward, his human legs unused to bearing his weight. He could feel the echo of the Pishach’s fragmented consciousness, not as a raging hunger, but as a faint, almost nostalgic whisper, a memory of its original purpose: to feed, to grow, to spread. And now, that purpose was being channeled through the grotesque idol.

He looked towards the direction of NIT Trichy. The faint hum of electricity, the sterile pulse of the campus, now seemed to carry a new resonance, a faint echo of the earth’s deep hum, a subtle, insidious call. The transplanted banyan, that distant anchor, was not just a passive recipient anymore. The events in Odisha had sent ripples through its very roots, awakening something within its sapling heart. The Pishach, or what remained of its essence, was now seeking a new vessel, a new point of manifestation, not through the corrupted roots of Arjun, but through the ancient, amplified power now housed within the rising idol.

The idol pulsed again, the amber light intensifying. The earth beneath it began to contract, to coalesce, forming a distinct, arboreal shape around the idol. It was not the towering, ancient banyan of the Odisha grove, but a smaller, more compact form, still rooted in the earth, its branches reaching out like gnarled fingers. It was a new tree, born from the purification of the Pishach’s corruption, a vessel for its re-purposed hunger. The idol was its heartwood, its core, its seed.

A chilling whisper, not of the Pishach, nor of the earth guardian, but a faint, disembodied echo of his own ancestor’s desperation, brushed against Arjun's consciousness: *"The sapling at Trichy… it was transplanted to dilute, to weaken. But dilution breeds fragmentation. Fragmentation breeds desperation. And desperation… seeks fertile ground."*

He understood now. The transplanted banyan at NIT Trichy was not just an anchor; it was a fragmented echo of the Mother Tree, a diluted essence susceptible to the Pishach’s influence. And the purified power now residing within the grotesque idol was not just appeasement, but a potent, concentrated seed, seeking precisely that fragmented, fertile ground. The *prana-vinimaya* curse had not ended with Rohan’s death or the Pishach’s dissolution. It had simply found a new, terrifying form of manifestation. The curse was no longer about a direct exchange; it was about *transference*, about infecting the world with a re-purposed, yet still insatiable, hunger.

As the newly formed tree solidified, its branches reaching towards the sky, a single, impossibly delicate root emerged from its base, not burrowing into the earth of Odisha, but stretching outwards, not towards the horizon, but *downwards*, as if seeking to anchor itself to something deeper, something more profound than the soil. It was a connection not of physical proximity, but of shared lineage, of corrupted origin. This new arboreal entity, born from the heartwood of appeasement and the essence of the Pishach, was reaching across the miles, not to the banyan at NIT Trichy, but to the very memory of the Pishach’s first manifestation, the place where its hunger had first been awakened.

Arjun watched, his human heart pounding with a dread that was both primal and intellectual. The new tree pulsed with a faint, amber light, its roots now coiling and twisting with a deliberate, almost sentient motion. It was not extending towards NIT Trichy, as he had first assumed. It was burrowing deeper into the Odisha earth, but not into the soil. It was seeking the primal roots of the Mother Tree itself, not to connect, but to usurp. The Vriksha-Pishach had been unmade, but its hunger, re-purposed and amplified, was now taking root in a far more terrifying form, seeking to devour the very source from which it had sprung. The tree before him, small and deceptively simple, pulsed with an ancient, hungry glow, its roots now a latticework of pulsing amber light, seeking to bind the Mother Tree itself. And as the first tendrils of amber light began to worm their way into the ancient roots of the colossal banyan, a new, guttural hiss echoed from the depths of the grove, a sound not of the Pishach, but of the Mother Tree itself, in its final, desperate defense.
