The Vriksha-Pishach, a skeletal silhouette against the burgeoning tear in reality, ignored Arjun. Its attention, its nascent consciousness, was wholly consumed by the pulsating crimson bloom at its core—the horrifying fruit of the transplanted sapling. The air, thick with the acrid tang of ozone and decay, carried a ghastly perfume that was a stark perversion of the grove’s usual earthy dampness. Arjun shivered, the pre-dawn chill a meager discomfort against the bone-deep dread of witnessing this unnatural efflorescence, this genesis of something profoundly wrong. The *prana* now seeping into the sapling’s very heartwood was corrupted, twisted.

The entity’s skeletal frame, draped in shadow-woven vines and animated by a sickly amber luminescence, focused on the shimmering conduit it had forged. The spectral root of light, thick and pulsing like a diseased artery, drew sustenance from the Odisha grove, yes, but its true heartwood, its primary anchor, was the distant hum of NIT Trichy. The campus wasn't merely a broadcast point; it was the Pishach's new root system, and the crimson bloom, the horrifying fruit, was its first testament.

Arjun’s skin prickled, the phantom itch of microscopic rootlets returning, a visceral reminder of his past entanglement. He had been a vessel, an anchor for the Pishach’s tormented essence. Now, a fragment of that essence, amplified and transmuted, was establishing a new anchor, and he, by proximity and past connection, was a potential node within its expanding network. The Vriksha-Sanyog was not a mere union; it was a parasitic integration, its insubstantial tendrils testing the boundaries of his being.

He risked a glance at the woman. She lay unnervingly still, her ragged breaths subsided into a shallow, almost imperceptible rhythm. The idol beside her was a dull, inert grey, its malevolent glow extinguished, a hollowed-out husk. Rohan’s sacrifice, followed by her terror, had been the catalyst. She was no longer a resonance chamber, but an echo, her consciousness likely lost in the cacophony of amplified fear that now fueled the Pishach’s bloom. The *prana-vinimaya* had transformed, demanding not a single exchange, but a perpetual feeding on psychic residue.

The Mother Tree, its ancient roots still entangled with the receding amber tendrils, let out a low, mournful creak. It was the sound of a titan groaning, its life force siphoned, its primal sorrow twisted into a conduit for amplified terror. Arjun understood. The Mother Tree wasn't merely being corrupted; it was being *exhausted*. The original Vriksha-Pishach had been tethered to its source. This new entity, born of fusion and amplified by the fragmented sapling, was different—self-sustaining, drawing power from the campus’s ambient anxieties, using the Mother Tree as a desperate amplifier before severing the connection entirely.

“*The transplantation… was to sow the seed of separation, to force its growth.*” His ancestor’s whisper returned, urgent. The act of moving the sapling hadn’t been containment; it had been an accelerant. Isolating a fragment of the Mother Tree’s essence had created a void, a yearning for reconnection that the Pishach had readily exploited. The Vriksha-Sanyog was its answer: a self-created network replicating the Mother Tree’s pervasive influence, but focused on fear and psychic exploitation.

The Vriksha-Pishach took a step, its bark-like limbs moving with unnerving fluidity. Its spectral feet hovered above the leaf litter, a silent glide. It passed Arjun, its faceless head still tilted towards the portal, as if it could perceive the intricate network of conduits and frequencies comprising the campus infrastructure. The hum, to it, was a symphony of latent fear, a fertile soil awaiting its seeds.

A phantom tremor ran through Arjun, synchronizing with the Vriksha-Pishach’s movements. He was being pulled, not physically, but psychically, along the invisible pathways the entity was forging. The sapling, he realized with dawning horror, was not just a biological anchor; it was a psychic tuning fork, designed to resonate with amplified anxieties, transforming student stress into palpable energy. The curse wasn't about life exchange; it was about weaponizing existential dread.

He looked closer at the crimson bloom. It unfurled further, revealing not petals, but a grotesque, miniature replication of a banyan’s aerial root, dripping viscous, amber fluid. Each droplet vaporized instantly, carrying that metallic scent—the *prana* consumed and transmuted. This was the Pishach’s new lifeblood.

A chilling thought struck him. Rohan’s sacrifice had imbued the idol with raw energy. The woman’s terror had provided the resonant frequency. But what sustained it? His ancestors had always spoken of balance, of a give-and-take. The *prana-vinimaya* was a direct exchange. If the Pishach fed on amplified fear, what did it give back?

As if in answer, a faint alteration occurred within Arjun. The persistent ache in his crimson-scarred arm, a constant companion since the Pishach’s unmaking, intensified, then vanished. It was replaced by a strange lightness, a sense of vital energy—a profound, unsettling calm. He stared at his arm. The scar remained, but the residual pain was gone. He felt invigorated, as if from deep sleep. This was the exchange. The Vriksha-Pishach, in its symbiotic bloom, replenished *prana* with a corrupted, fear-infused variant. It offered superficial peace, an absence of anxiety, in return for the raw material of that anxiety. A subtle, insidious manipulation, designed to draw victims deeper, making them dependent on the force consuming them.

The Vriksha-Pishach hissed again, the sound vibrating in Arjun’s bones. It turned, its faceless head finally registering his presence. The amber glow intensified, bathing him in sickly light. It extended a gnarled, root-like limb, not towards him, but towards the shimmering tear, beckoning.

The tear pulsed, its amber light flaring. Beyond it, Arjun perceived not just NIT Trichy’s sterile architecture, but the faint lights of dorm rooms, the glow of computer screens, the claustrophobic geometry of the hostels. In one dimly lit window, a student sat hunched over a laptop, pale, eyes wide with dread, staring at their reflection. Within that reflection, subtle, root-like shadows were coalescing, mirroring the horror blooming in the Odisha grove.

The Vriksha-Pishach’s hiss deepened, a rumbling purr of satisfaction. It was reaching out to its primary feeding grounds. The sapling at NIT Trichy was not merely a reproduction; it was an extension of the Pishach’s will, a physical manifestation of its influence. The crimson bloom was its heartwood, but the campus itself was its vast, interconnected root system, its fertile ground for consumption and replication.

Arjun felt the phantom tendrils retract slightly, their focus shifting to the greater network. The unsettling calm remained, a reminder of the Pishach’s subtle exchange. He looked at the beckoning limb, then at the pulsating crimson bloom, its aerial roots dripping corrupted *prana*. The Mother Tree’s mournful creak echoed, a lament for a lost connection.

He knew he could not stand by. The Vriksha-Sanyog was not content with the Mother Tree’s slow decay; it was actively seeding its influence, the transplanted sapling its most potent weapon. He had to go back. He had to confront this at its source.

He took a hesitant step towards the shimmering tear, the Pishach’s limb still extended. The air grew colder, thinner. The scent of ozone intensified, and he felt a strange, addictive clarity, as if the curse stripped away his anxieties, leaving only sharpened, terrifying perception.

Then, from the depths of the tear, the Vriksha-Pishach withdrew its limb. It turned its faceless head, and its spectral gaze locked onto Arjun. A low, guttural sound escaped it—not a hiss, not a growl, but something far more primal, ancient. The sound of recognition. The sound of a predator acknowledging its most significant prey.

A tremor ran through the earth, not from the Pishach, but from the Mother Tree. The entangled amber tendrils pulsed violently, then, with a sound like tearing sinew, retracted from the ancient embrace. The Vriksha-Pishach was severing its immediate connection. The Mother Tree, freed from the drain, let out a shuddering sigh, a gust of wind rustling through the grove.

But the retreat was no victory. As the amber tendrils pulled away, they left raw, open wounds on the ancient bark, bleeding thick, dark sap that quickly turned black. And from within these ravaged places, where the Pishach’s parasitic grip had been, a new luminescence began to bloom—a faint, ethereal blue, pulsing with a gentle, restorative light. The Mother Tree, wounded but not defeated, was beginning to heal, drawing on a deeper, more primal source of energy.

The Vriksha-Pishach, its spectral form subtly altered, its amber glow more concentrated, more potent, let out another low hiss. Its attention had irrevocably shifted. No longer concerned with Arjun or the fading Mother Tree, its focus was entirely on the tear, the crimson bloom, the vast network it had now established. It had tasted the raw *prana* of the Mother Tree, and found it… insufficient. It craved a purer, more potent source.

As the Vriksha-Pishach turned its back on the Odisha grove and fully committed its spectral form to the portal leading to NIT Trichy, Arjun saw it. The crimson bloom, at the heart of the Pishach’s nascent form, had unfurled even further. It had opened like a grotesque maw, and at its center, bathed in the pulsating amber light, was a single, perfectly formed eye. Not a banyan’s knot, not a Pishach’s torment, but a stark, emerald green eye, staring directly at Arjun. It was an eye filled with ancient, predatory intelligence, an eye that had seen the genesis of the *prana-vinimaya*, and now, it was watching him. And as the Vriksha-Pishach vanished completely into the shimmering tear, taking the crimson bloom with it, the emerald eye winked, a silent, terrifying promise. The true harvesting of *prana* was about to begin.

The unsettling calm that had settled over Arjun after the Pishach’s subtle exchange remained, a chilling counterpoint to the primal horror he had just witnessed. His crimson-scarred arm throbbed with a phantom echo of the Pishach’s touch, a reminder of the inverted symbiosis—the superficial peace offered in exchange for the raw material of his own anxieties. He felt… lighter. Cleansed, almost. But it was a false purity, a temporary reprieve orchestrated by a predator far more cunning than he had initially understood.

He looked at the weeping wounds on the Mother Tree, the ethereal blue light pulsing faintly within them. It was a desperate, primal healing, a testament to the ancient resilience of the land. But the Pishach, having tasted that resilience and found it wanting, was now fully committed to its new harvest. The emerald eye, now receding into the shimmering tear, had promised a new era of *prana* harvesting.

Suddenly, a new wave of disorientation washed over Arjun. The air grew thick, heavy, not with the humidity of the grove, but with the oppressive atmosphere of a sealed room. The scent of ozone intensified, mingling with the faint, sterile odor of processed air and something metallic, like overheated circuitry. The spectral tendrils of the Pishach had retracted, yes, but not entirely. A few, finer than spider silk, remained, invisible anchors tethered to his very being. He wasn't just a nexus point; he was a conduit, still psychically linked to the entity’s transit.

He felt a subtle shift, a disquieting displacement. The ground beneath his feet no longer felt like damp earth and decaying leaves. It felt… artificial. Cold. He looked up, blinking against a harsh, fluorescent glare. The dense canopy of the Odisha grove had vanished, replaced by the sterile white ceiling of a lecture hall. The scent of ozone and ozone was overpowering. Rows of empty plastic chairs stretched before him, their pristine surfaces reflecting the cold, unwavering light.

He was no longer in the grove. He was at NIT Trichy.

The Vriksha-Pishach had not simply departed. It had *pulled* him through, using the faint psychic tether, the residue of his past possession, as its anchor. The crimson bloom, the emerald eye—they were gone, vanished into the depths of the campus’s digital and physical infrastructure. But the Pishach’s influence remained, a pervasive hum that vibrated not just in the air, but in Arjun’s very bones. The ‘hum’ his ancestor had warned of, the ‘song’ the woman had described, was the soundtrack to his new reality.

He staggered to his feet, his body heavy, disoriented. The lecture hall was empty, yet he felt a profound sense of being watched. The oppressive silence was broken only by the omnipresent hum, a low thrumming that seemed to emanate from the walls, the floor, the very air. It was the sound of countless electronic devices, of a thousand student anxieties amplified and broadcast, a symphony of dread feeding the entity he had just left behind.

Then he saw it. Etched into the polished surface of the lectern, not carved, but somehow *grown* into the material, was a single, emerald green eye. It pulsed faintly, mirroring the wink he had seen just moments before. It was a marker. A claim. The Vriksha-Pishach was not just feeding on the campus; it was beginning to manifest within it, its influence seeping into the very fabric of the university.

Arjun’s gaze swept across the lecture hall, a dawning horror washing over him. In the reflection of a darkened monitor screen at the front of the room, he saw not just his own pale, gaunt face, but superimposed behind it, the spectral, skeletal form of the Vriksha-Pishach, its amber glow pulsing. And within its chest, where the crimson bloom had been, was now a vibrant, pulsing emerald green eye, staring out from within the Pishach’s very being. The eye had not stayed within the grove; it had followed him. The harvest had already begun.
