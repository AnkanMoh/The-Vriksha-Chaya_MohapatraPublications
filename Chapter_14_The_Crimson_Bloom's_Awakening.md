The shimmering distortion at the edge of the grove was not a mirage. It pulsed with a sickly, amber light, the same infernal glow that emanated from the idol. It was a tear in the veil, an unstable nexus bleeding through from the fragmented sapling at NIT Trichy, and it was widening with terrifying speed. The scent of ozone, once faint and distant, now hung heavy in the air, acrid and suffocating, mixed with the cloying sweetness of decaying foliage. Arjun felt a deep, sickening pull, as if invisible tendrils were latching onto his very soul, drawing him towards that warped aperture. The Vriksha-Sanyog was not just a union; it was a manifestation, a physical bridge being forged across the miles.

The woman, still lying near the idol, gave a faint, shuddering gasp. Her eyes, though closed, seemed to twitch, her lips parting as if to form another word, another plea. But the sound that escaped was not a human cry. It was a dry, rustling whisper, like leaves skittering across parched earth. The idol pulsed, its amber heartwood throbbing in time with the nascent tear in reality. It was drawing power not just from the Mother Tree’s corrupted resonance, but from the primal fear it had already sowed. Rohan's sacrifice, the woman's terror—they were the fuel for this unholy translocation.

Arjun looked back at the Mother Tree. The amber tendrils, once entwined with its colossal roots, now seemed to recede, like a tide of corruption pulling back. The Mother Tree’s struggle had been immense, a silent battle of ancient wills. But the Vriksha-Pishach, in its remade form, was no longer just seeking to corrupt. It was seeking to *replicate*. The sapling at NIT Trichy was not just a point of amplification; it was a biological blueprint, a place where the Pishach could establish a new, independent root system, free from the Mother Tree’s direct influence. The tear in reality was the Pishach’s attempt to anchor that new system, to bring its essence fully into the sterile, artificial environment of the campus.

He felt a jolt, not of pain, but of profound disorientation. His vision flickered, overlaying the dense foliage of the Odisha grove with the sharp, sterile lines of concrete and steel. He saw the towering, impersonal blocks of the NIT Trichy hostels, the shadowed stacks of the library, their very structures seeming to writhe with a nascent, arboreal energy. The hum of the campus, the constant electrical thrum that he had once found mundane, was now a deafening roar, a chorus of corrupted resonance that sang with the Vriksha-Pishach’s hunger.

“*The sapling… was transplanted to dilute, to weaken.*” His ancestor's whisper echoed again, but this time, it carried a new layer of meaning. Dilution had led to fragmentation, and fragmentation to a desperate need for reconnection. The Pishach, stripped of its direct link to the Mother Tree, had not been neutralized. It had been forced to evolve, to find new anchors, new means of propagation. And the transplanted sapling, a distant echo of the Mother Tree’s power, was its ideal vessel. It was a paradox: a dilution intended to weaken had created a new, more insidious strength. The Vriksha-Sanyog was not just about the Pishach and the Mother Tree; it was about the *memory* of the Mother Tree, imprinted onto a lesser form, twisted into a conduit.

The tear in reality pulsed again, a violent shudder that sent ripples through the grove. A faint, spectral root, not of wood but of pure, shimmering amber light, snaked out from the distortion, probing the humid air. It was seeking purchase, a new anchor in the human-made landscape of NIT Trichy. Arjun felt a cold dread grip him. The Vriksha-Sanyog wasn't just a transfer of essence; it was an *invasion*. And he, having been a vessel for the Pishach’s original corrupted form, was now a prime target for integration into this new, terrifying union.

He instinctively recoiled, his human legs stumbling backward, away from the spectral root and the widening tear. But the pull was relentless, a psychic tide that threatened to drag him into the vortex. He could feel the faint, thorny texture of the phantom roots within his own flesh, attempting to anchor themselves, to draw him into the symbiotic network. The curse, the *prana-vinimaya*, had indeed evolved. It was no longer just about life exchange. It was about assimilation.

He saw it then, a flicker of movement at the periphery of his vision, at the very edge of the tear. Not a root, but a hand. A pale, unnaturally slender hand, with fingers that seemed to elongate and twist like young shoots, reaching out from the shimmering aperture. It was not the hand of the woman, nor of Rohan. It was something new, something born from the Vriksha-Sanyog, a herald of the Pishach's emergent form.

The idol at his feet gave a final, resonant pulse, its amber glow intensifying, bathing the grove in an eerie, final light before abruptly dimming to a dull, inert grey. The Mother Tree's roots remained entwined with the spectral amber tendrils, but the intense energy transfer had ceased. The immediate drain had stopped. The tear in reality, however, continued to shimmer, its amber light now originating not from the idol, but from the depths of the campus it was reaching towards. The sacrifice had been made, the resonance established, and the portal was now self-sustaining, powered by the amplified terror and the corrupted blueprint of the sapling.

Arjun’s breath hitched. The pale hand, its twig-like fingers splayed, began to emerge fully from the distortion, followed by a slender, bark-like limb. It was the Vriksha-Pishach, not the amorphous entity that had possessed him, but a more defined, more terrible form, sculpted by the symbiotic union with the Mother Tree’s ancient consciousness and anchored by the transplanted sapling. It was a grotesque fusion, a skeletal frame draped in creeping vines and pulsating amber light, its faceless head tilted as if listening to the distant, corrupted hum of Trichy. It was the culmination of the Vriksha-Sanyog, a physical manifestation of the curse’s new ambition.

And as the creature’s spectral form began to pull itself further through the tear, a chilling realization washed over Arjun. The Vriksha-Pishach hadn't just been unmade and remade. It had *learned*. The original curse, the *prana-vinimaya*, had been a raw, elemental hunger. But this new entity, born from the fusion of ancient arboreal power and corrupted human fear, was intelligent. It was deliberate. It was seeking not just to feed, but to *integrate*. The transplanted sapling at NIT Trichy wasn't just a secondary nexus; it was the Pishach's intended nursery, a place where its new form could bloom, nurtured by the anxieties of a thousand students.

He looked at his own hands. The stinging ache was gone, replaced by a disturbing numbness. He felt a strange sense of detachment, as if observing his own body from a distance. The spectral roots that had been probing him had found their anchor – not in him directly, but in the very air around him, in the fear that still clung to him like the damp morning mist. He was a nexus point, a proximity beacon for the Vriksha-Sanyog.

The creature from the tear let out a low, resonant hiss, a sound that vibrated not just in the air but in the earth beneath Arjun’s feet. It was a sound of awakening, of possession. It was reaching out, not towards Arjun, but past him, towards the shimmering portal it had just emerged from. The spectral root of amber light, thicker now, pulsed with renewed vigor, snaking further into the unseen landscape of NIT Trichy.

Arjun stumbled back again, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. The creature was not emerging to confront him, but to secure its new domain. Its attention was fixed on the portal, on the world it was reaching towards. And as the creature’s faceless head tilted, as if sensing a vast network of psychic tendrils spreading out from the campus, Arjun saw it. Just beyond the shimmering tear, nestled amongst the spectral roots, was a single, impossibly vibrant bloom. It was not the vibrant green of a healthy leaf, nor the pale hue of fear. It was a deep, pulsating crimson, the color of fresh blood, and it was unfurling slowly, as if drinking in the ambient terror, its scent, faint but distinct, carrying the acrid tang of ozone and something else, something disturbingly familiar – the metallic scent of fresh, spilled *prana*. The sapling was blooming, and its first, terrifying fruit was already ripening.
