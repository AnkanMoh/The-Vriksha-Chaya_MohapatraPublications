The amber tendrils of the nascent arboreal entity, born from the Pishach’s re-purified essence and the grotesque idol, writhed within the colossal roots of the Mother Tree. It was not a parasitic consumption, Arjun realized with dawning horror, but a parasitic symphony. The Pishach, in its new form, sought resonance, attuning itself to the ancient consciousness of the Mother Tree, its hunger amplified by the land’s own vibrations. The curse, the *prana-vinimaya*, had transformed, no longer demanding a simple exchange of life, but manipulating the very fabric of existence through sympathetic resonance.

Arjun, his human form still reeling from the Pishach’s unmaking, felt the subtle shifts in the grove’s energy. The whispers of his ancestors echoed in his mind: *"The sapling at Trichy… fragmented. Desperation… fertile ground."* The transplanted banyan, a diluted echo of the Mother Tree, was the key – a vulnerability in the vast network, a node perfect for amplification. The curse wasn’t about brute force; it was about finding the weakest link.

The Mother Tree’s earth-shaking hiss subsided, replaced by a low, resonant hum. The Pishach’s amplified essence was establishing its insidious connection. But then, a sharp metallic clang shattered the fragile harmony, followed by a muffled cry from the direction of the shrine where Rohan had unearthed the idol. Human intrusion.

Arjun stumbled towards the sound, his senses hyper-aware. He found a young woman, no older than himself, sprawled near the shrine, her eyes wide with a terror that was silent yet deafening. The idol lay nearby, its amber glow dimmed. She wasn’t convulsing like Rohan; her torment was subtler, a psychological invasion. A faint, piercing whine emanated from her, the sound of amplified fear.

The idol, Arjun realized, was not just a vessel for the Pishach’s essence, but a broadcaster. Rohan had been a sacrifice, his life force consumed. This woman, however, was a resonance chamber, her fear a signal seeking its counterpart. The *prana-vinimaya* had evolved again, capable of inducing and broadcasting terror itself.

As Arjun reached for her, a pressure built in his own mind, fleeting images of his failures flashing before him. The amplified fear was finding its resonance, not just in the woman, but in him. The curse wasn’t about the Vriksha-Pishach, he understood with chilling clarity. It was about the *root* of resonance, the inherent connection between all living things, twisted and weaponized.

The woman’s scream intensified, a piercing shriek of psychological annihilation. The Mother Tree’s amber roots pulsed violently, sending a wave of amplified resonance across the miles, towards the sapling at NIT Trichy. The terror was taking root. It was coming home.
