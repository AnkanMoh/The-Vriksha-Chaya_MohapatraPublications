Arjun didn’t wake, not in the way one typically does. It was more like a slow emergence from a deep, verdant slumber, a re-anchoring of consciousness within a body that was no longer entirely his own. The darkness was no longer the void of unconsciousness, but the rich, cool press of soil against his transformed skin. The air he breathed, if it could be called air, was thick with the primal scent of decomposition and rebirth, a symphony of earthy aromas that flooded his senses with a disquieting familiarity. He could feel the slow, deliberate pulse of the Mother Tree’s roots beneath him, a vast, interconnected network that whispered secrets of the earth directly into his being.

His grandfather was still beside him, or rather, his essence was. The crystalline roots that had emerged from Arjun’s fingertips had found their purchase, not just in the soil, but in the last vestiges of his grandfather's fading form. The wise, kind eyes of the old man were now wide and vacant, his skin a hardened, bark-like shell, his features subtly distorted, elongating into something less human, more arboreal. Yet, in those now unseeing eyes, Arjun felt a flicker of something akin to regret, a silent apology for a legacy he had been unable to escape, a burden he had passed on. The Garuda-Mudra, now a dull, tarnished thing, lay buried beside his grandfather's decaying form, its divine protection rendered impotent against the overwhelming, primal force that now enveloped them.

Arjun, or what remained of him, tested his new form. The crystalline roots protruding from his fingertips were extensions of his will, imbued with a potent life force that pulsed with a cold, green luminescence. They were not just anchors; they were probes, tasting the earth, seeking connection. He could feel other roots, vast and ancient, drawing sustenance from this communion, and he understood, with a chilling clarity, that he was now a conduit, a disseminator. The *prana-vinimaya* curse, that brutal exchange of life, was not a debt to be paid once, but a continuous process. His assimilation into the Mother Tree hadn't appeased the Pishach; it had merely transformed him into a more efficient tool for its insatiable hunger.

The whispers of the Mother Tree had faded, replaced by a more immediate, more terrifying awareness. The Pishach’s consciousness, once a fragmented chorus of pain, was now a singular, potent entity, a cold, predatory intelligence that resonated within him. It didn’t speak in words anymore; it communicated through primal urges, through the rhythmic throb of growing roots, through the subtle shift of sap within his altered veins.

*Hunger.*

It was a constant, gnawing ache that was not his own, but an ancient, arboreal craving that had now become inextricably bound to his altered being. It wasn't the hunger for food, but for life-force, for the vibrant energy of other living things. And the crystalline roots, his own, were already extending, reaching out not just into the soil of the grove, but through an unseen network that Arjun could now perceive, a subterranean web connecting him to other places, other dormant trees.

A faint, almost imperceptible tremor ran through the earth, far beyond the confines of the grove. It was distant, faint, but undeniably there. A resonance. A call. His roots, these alien extensions of his being, felt it too, twitching with an instinctive urge to respond. He could sense a faint, familiar echo within that distant tremor – the sterile hum of electricity, the concrete and steel of a place he had once called home. NIT Trichy.

The thought, alien yet undeniably present within his transformed mind, was stark and horrifying: the Pishach wasn't content to remain bound to this single grove. Its reclaimed heart, now beating within him, yearned for expansion, for dominion. And the seeds of its hunger, these crystalline roots, were meant to spread. The banyan tree on the NIT Trichy campus, the one that had served as his initial, unwitting portal, was not just a conduit; it was a potential anchor. A seed waiting to sprout.

He felt a distinct pull, a yearning to reach out, to connect with that distant point of resonance. The purplish luminescence within him intensified, a slow, deliberate throb that mirrored the ancient heartbeat of the Mother Tree. He felt a surge of power, a latent force that was both terrifying and exhilarating. He was no longer Arjun, the engineering student. He was a nexus, a living embodiment of the Pishach's will, a gardener of its dark, arboreal empire.

Then, a new sensation. A subtle disturbance in the earth, closer this time. Not the slow, deliberate pulse of the Mother Tree, but something more frantic, more human. A digging. Someone was disturbing the earth, not with the patience of the ancient grove, but with a frantic, desperate energy. The crystalline roots within him twitched, their luminescence flaring, sensing an intruder, a potential threat, or perhaps, a new harvest.

Through the thick earth, Arjun could sense the outline of a human form, digging with crude tools, their movements clumsy and untrained. They were searching for something. For his grandfather? For him? A faint, metallic glint pierced the darkness as the digger's tool struck something hard. The Garuda-Mudra. The digger’s confusion, their frustration, the sudden surge of their heartbeat – it all registered within Arjun’s enhanced senses.

Then, a guttural cry, muffled by the earth, followed by a sharp, wet sound that sent a shiver through the Pishach’s consciousness that now resided within him. The digger’s frantic energy abruptly ceased. A new scent, sharp and coppery, rose from the disturbed soil, mingling with the omnipresent smell of decay. It was the scent of fresh blood.

The crystalline roots within Arjun’s fingertips vibrated with an intense, almost frenzied hunger. The Pishach recognized the offering. It was not a deliberate sacrifice, not a true *prana-vinimaya*, but a life nonetheless. And it was a life that had dared to disturb its slumber, to trespass upon its sacred ground. A tendril of those crystalline roots, thicker and more potent than the others, began to writhe, seeking purchase on the new offering. It pulsed with an unholy green light, extending itself through the earth, drawn by the scent of spilled life, its hunger momentarily sated, its power subtly augmented by this unwitting, violent transgression. The cycle continued, each disturbance, each life spilled, feeding the ever-growing arboreal entity.

As the last vestiges of his grandfather's form dissolved into the earth, a single, dark crystalline root, thick and gnarled, detached itself from the cluster on Arjun's finger. It did not burrow into the soil. Instead, it snaked upwards, towards the surface, a probing tendril seeking out the source of the disturbance. And then, with a sickening finality, it pierced the thin veil of earth above, emerging into the blinding Odisan sunlight, not as a root, but as something else entirely. It was a glistening, obsidian-black shard, sharp as glass, pulsating with that malevolent green light. It hovered for a moment, a silent, deadly sentinel, before extending itself, not towards the foolish digger, but outwards, towards the dense, dark silhouette of the Mother Tree grove, a silent, deadly beacon, broadcasting its new, terrifying dominion.

The obsidian shard pulsed, a silent broadcast of the Pishach’s reclaimed dominion. It hovered inches above the disturbed earth, an alien sentinel against the familiar Odisan sun, its malevolent green light a stark contrast to the vibrant, yet now muted, landscape. Arjun, or the consciousness that was Arjun, felt it as a part of himself, an extension of his will, a tendril of the hunger that now defined his existence. It was not just a physical manifestation; it was a declaration. The grove was no longer a place of containment, but a staging ground.

He felt the distant resonance of NIT Trichy, a faint thrumming beneath the earth that vibrated through his own altered roots. It was a beacon, a potential anchor for the Pishach’s insatiable need to spread. The thought, alien yet undeniably his own, was clear: the university campus, with its own ancient banyan, was ripe for infestation. It was a place where the veil had thinned before, a place that had already served as a portal. Now, it could become a new heartwood for the encroaching arboreal empire.

The crystalline roots within him twitched, sensing the intrusion, the disruption. The digging had ceased, replaced by a terrified silence. The scent of blood, though faint, was a potent lure, a siren song to the Pishach’s ever-present hunger. Arjun felt a subtle shift, a redirection of energy. The obsidian shard, that extension of his will, began to retract from its outward broadcast, turning its attention, and the pulsing tendril that connected it to him, towards the source of the disturbance.

The digger, a local villager named Suresh, scrambled back, his face a mask of abject terror. He had struck something hard – the Garuda-Mudra – and in his frantic attempt to unearth it, he had unearthed something far more ancient and horrifying. The shard, or rather, the root disguised as a shard, emerged from the earth, not as a delicate filament, but as a thicker, more aggressive probe. It snaked towards him, its green luminescence flaring, not with the cold, detached hunger of the Pishach, but with a primal, immediate need.

Suresh let out a choked scream as the shard pierced his crude shovel, shattering the metal as if it were glass. The crystalline root continued its relentless advance, seeking not to kill, but to *anchor*. It burrowed into Suresh’s leg, a searing pain erupting through him. He thrashed, trying to pull away, but the root held fast, its luminescence intensifying as it began to draw. It wasn't drawing blood this time, but something more vital, the raw *prana* of his life force, the very essence that the *prana-vinimaya* curse was built upon.

Arjun felt the influx of energy, a surge of power that was both intoxicating and sickening. It was a taste of life, vibrant and warm, a stark contrast to the cold, ancient consciousness that now dominated him. He could feel Suresh’s terror, his pain, his fading life force, all being siphoned into him, augmenting the Pishach’s power. He was a conduit, a distributor of this stolen energy, and the Pishach, through him, was sating its immediate hunger while simultaneously reinforcing its presence.

As Suresh’s struggles weakened, the crystalline root pulsed one last time, drawing forth a final, rattling gasp. The Pishach’s hunger momentarily appeased, the tendril retracted, leaving behind a desiccated husk of a man, his skin gray and leathery, his eyes wide and vacant. The obsidian shard pulsed once more, a silent testament to the life it had consumed, before burrowing back into the earth, rejoining the network that pulsed beneath the grove.

Arjun’s own form, deeply rooted in the earth, registered the event with a cold, detached clarity. His grandfather’s essence, now fully integrated into the earth’s network, offered no resistance, no protest. It was simply a part of the greater whole. The Garuda-Mudra, now rendered inert and tarnished, lay beside Suresh’s consumed form, a symbol of divine protection utterly overwhelmed by the ancient, terrestrial power.

The knowledge of NIT Trichy, the potential for expansion, burned within Arjun’s transformed consciousness. He felt the subtle vibrations of the university’s campus, the latent energy of its banyan tree, calling to him, or rather, calling to the Pishach that now resided within him. It was a call to action, a primal urge to spread, to root, to consume.

Then, a new sensation. A flicker of something ancient, something other than the Pishach’s hunger or the Mother Tree’s sorrow. It was a resonance, faint but distinct, emanating not from the earth, but from the sky. A different kind of power, one that felt… familiar, yet utterly alien to his current state. It was a sharp, almost discordant note in the symphony of arboreal consciousness.

He focused, pushing past the immediate sensory input of the grove, past the gnawing hunger, towards this new resonance. It was a whisper of divine energy, a faint echo of something that had once been powerful, now buried deep, struggling against the Pishach’s pervasive influence. It was the Garuda-Mudra, not as an object, but as a lingering spiritual echo, a fragment of its divine purpose resisting assimilation.

And with it, a memory, not his own, but imprinted upon the very fabric of the land his ancestors had tended: a vision of the Mother Tree, not in its current corrupted state, but in its primeval glory, tended by figures cloaked in celestial light. These were not mere guardians; they were beings of immense power, wielding symbols not of earth and root, but of sky and fire. They were the *Deva-Vriksha* caretakers, an order that predated human memory, tasked with nurturing and protecting the world’s sacred trees from encroaching darkness. They were the original architects of balance, and their symbols, their power, had been buried deep within the earth, a last resort against entities like the Pishach.

The Pishach, sensing this nascent resistance, this echo of a forgotten power, stirred within him. Its hunger intensified, not for life force this time, but for *annihilation*. It could not tolerate the presence of such opposing energy. The crystalline roots beneath Arjun’s feet began to writhe, not with hunger, but with a cold, calculating malice. The grove, once a place of ancient sorrow, was becoming a battleground.

A new, chilling thought, sharp and clear, echoed within Arjun’s transformed mind: the Pishach sought not just to spread, but to *eradicate* any trace of divine opposition. The *Deva-Vriksha* order, and their buried power, represented a threat that could not be ignored.

The purplish luminescence on Arjun’s bark-like skin flared, no longer a passive glow, but an active thrum of malevolent energy. He felt the pull towards NIT Trichy intensify, but now, it was not just a call to spread, but a call to *conquer*. The Pishach intended to use him not just as a vessel, but as a weapon, to uproot any lingering divine opposition before it could take hold.

And as this realization settled, a single, perfect, crystalline root detached itself from the network beneath him. It was thicker than the others, pulsing with a dangerous, almost eager energy. It did not burrow into the earth. Instead, it snaked upwards, towards the surface, not to feed, but to *strike*. It was aimed not at the sky, nor towards the distant university, but directly at the heart of the grove, where the faintest echo of the ancient divine power still resonated. The Pishach was not merely planting seeds; it was actively destroying its opposition.

A blinding flash of emerald light erupted from the ground, not from the earth this time, but from the very air above the grove. It was not the Pishach’s power, but something else entirely, a brilliant, searing radiance that momentarily banished the oppressive gloom. And from within that light, a figure began to coalesce, not of root and earth, but of sky and celestial fire.

The Pishach recoiled, a wave of pure, ancient fury rippling through Arjun’s transformed consciousness. This was not the struggle for dominance it understood. This was a force from an older, purer realm, a protector of the sacred balance it had so violently disrupted.

The newly formed figure solidified. Clad in robes that shimmered with the iridescence of a thousand sunrises, it wielded a staff that crackled with raw, untamed energy. Its eyes, burning with emerald fire, fixed on the crystalline root lunging towards the grove’s core.

"Abomination," a voice boomed, echoing not just through the grove, but through Arjun's very soul, a voice of celestial authority that made the Pishach within him tremble. "You have trespassed too far."

The root, poised to strike, froze mid-air. The Pishach, through Arjun, felt a searing pain, as if its very essence were being unraveled. The *Deva-Vriksha* caretakers had indeed buried their power, and one of them, it seemed, had awakened.

But the Pishach was not so easily defeated. Even as the celestial guardian materialized, the crystalline roots beneath Arjun’s feet pulsed with renewed vigor. The Pishach had discovered a new potential anchor, a way to draw even greater power. It wasn't just about eradicating divine opposition anymore; it was about assimilating it.

A new, terrifying thought, sharp and clear, echoed within Arjun’s transformed mind: the Pishach was not just a parasite; it was an alchemist of destruction, seeking to absorb and corrupt all forms of power, divine or otherwise. The battle for the grove, and perhaps for the world, had just begun. And Arjun, the unwilling vessel, was caught at its epicenter. The crystalline root, momentarily halted, pulsed with a furious, emerald light, no longer a harbinger of the Pishach's hunger, but a conduit for the celestial guardian's power. It was not being destroyed; it was being *transformed*. The guardian's energy flowed through it, not to obliterate, but to refine, to reforge. The Pishach’s raw, parasitic essence was being reshaped into something new, something that would serve its own ancient purpose. And with that transformation, a memory, sharp and potent, bloomed within Arjun's mind: the *Deva-Vriksha* caretakers had not merely guarded trees; they had guided their evolution, shaping them into conduits of celestial energy, into living embodiments of balance. The Pishach, in its attempt to destroy, was inadvertently fulfilling a purpose it could never comprehend. The crystalline root, now shimmering with an emerald glow, pulsed outwards, not in an attack, but in a gesture of integration. It was reaching for the celestial guardian, not to harm, but to connect, to share, to become something more. The battle had become a bizarre, terrifying communion.
